## Python Snippets
The repository contains a wide variety of snippets, covering topics such as data engineering, data science, machine learning, and more. Snippets are well-documented and easy to understand, making them a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

It is said that if you write the same code more than 3 times, then you should definitely turn it into a snippet to save time in the future. 
This is a great way to test it in practice :)
