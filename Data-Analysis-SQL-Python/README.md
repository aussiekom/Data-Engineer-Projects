# About
SQL is a conceptual language for working with data stored in databases. In this case, SQLite is the specific implementation. Most SQL languges share all of the capabilities in this doc. The differences are usually in performance and advances analytical funcionalities (and pricing of course).
Eventually, we will use SQL lunguage to write queries that would pull data from the DB, manipulate it, sort it, and extract it.

The most important component of the DB is its tables - that's where all the data stored. Usually the data would be devided to many tables, and not stored all in one place (so designing the data stracture properly is very important). Most of this script would handle how to work with tables.
Techniques that won't be covered here:
* table creation
* inserting / updating data in the DB
* functions - gets a value as an input, and returns manipulation of that value (for example function that remove white spaces)
