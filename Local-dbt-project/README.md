## Local dbt project 

Here is a step by step process for creating a dbt project on a local machine using Docker. We’ve built two images, one for the Postgres database that also populates the Sakila database, and another one for our dbt environment.

It’s important to be able to quickly build some example projects with data build tool that can then be used as a testing environment or even a playground for experimenting and learning.
