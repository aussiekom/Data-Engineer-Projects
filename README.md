# Data Engineer Project
**About:**
Gans is a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system. It aspires to operate in the most populous cities all around the world. In each city, it will have hundreds of e-scooters parked in the streets and allow users to rent them by the minute. 

**The goal** for this project is to collect data from external sources that can potentially help the company predict e-scooter movement. Since data is needed every day, in real-time, and accessible by everyone in the company, the solution is to assemble and automate a data pipeline in the cloud.

Data was collected regarding population, weather, and arrivals.
